# Lab 4 - Full Stack Application with Spring Boot and ReactJS

## Introduction to the Lab

This lab focuses on building a full-stack application by integrating a Spring Boot backend with a ReactJS frontend.

## 4.1 First Dummy App with ReactJS

**Overview**: ReactJS is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It relies on components and hooks like `useState` and `useEffect` to manage data

**Vite Setup**:Node.js installed (v22.11.0 or higher) and npm (v10.9.0 or higher). Used Vite to create a new React project with optimized performance.


### Key Terminal Commands

- `npm create vite@latest Ex1 --template react`: Create a new React application with Vite.
- `npm install`: Install all necessary dependencies after creating the Vite project.
- `npm run dev`: Start the Vite development server.

## 4.2 Props and State in React

**Props and State**: Essential for data flow and dynamic updates in React applications. Props allow data to be passed from parent to child components, while state allows components to manage their own dynamic data.


## 4.3 Consuming REST API Services

**useEffect and useState Hooks**: These hooks allow components and state management, making API calls and handling responses.

**API Integration**:`fetch` API to connect the React frontend to RESTful endpoints provided by the Spring Boot backend.

### Key Terminal Commands

- `npm create vite@latest Ex3 --template react`: Create a new React application with Vite.
- `npm install`: Install all necessary dependencies after creating the Vite project.
- `npm run dev`: Start the Vite development server.
